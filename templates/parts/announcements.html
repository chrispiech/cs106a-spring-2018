        I hope this announcement finds you well. Most importantly, I hope you are all finding your learning zen this evening as we wrap up CS106A. You have come a long way and I see your hard work. CS106A is not an easy course. All the best with studying tonight, download your exam, get a good nights rest and we will see you tomorrow. Respect.

    <p>
        The CS106A exam is ready to download (see the <a href="{{pathToRoot}}handouts/final.html"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true" title="pdf"></span> final exam page</a>). Make sure to download and test the software on your computer before the final exam tomorrow morning.

            The final exam is Monday, March 19, from 8:30AM - 11:30AM. It's on a computer, so don't forget your laptop as well as a charger if you feel you'll need it! <b> Please make sure to disable notifications on your computer for the duration of the exam </b>. Bluebook detects when you swap away from your screen, and disabling notifications reduces the risk of that.

            In section this week, we built a server program that helps a client to schedule a flight itinerary. The second part of the section handout involves writing a <code>ConsoleProgram</code> that can act as a client to this server. 

            In the real world, many clients aren't <code>ConsoleProgam</code>s but rather websites. To give you an example of how a server that you might write might work with a website, we've made a small sample webpage that works by making requests to your <code>FlightPlannerServer</code> program:
    </p>
            <br />
            <img src="{{pathToRoot}}/img/general/flightplanner.png" style="width:100%">
            &nbsp;
    <p>
            If you're interested in trying this out for yourself, download the eclipse project <a href="https://github.com/brahmcapoor/CS106-teaching-materials/raw/master/CS106A/FlightPlanner/download.zip" target="_blank"> here </a>, and open <code>webpage/index.html</code> in your browser. The page will have instructions as to how to set up your server! 
    </p>

    <p>
            If you have any questions about how this webpage works or if something doesn't appear to be working, shoot Brahm an email at <a href="mailto:brahm@stanford.edu"> brahm@stanford.edu </a>.

            If you believe part of your exam was incorrectly graded, regrade requests will be accepted through <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/WzSBM6RazMIVx9t02">https://goo.gl/forms/WzSBM6RazMIVx9t02</a> until <strong>Wednesday, May 23.</strong>  As part of your request, you will need to provide a short write-up of the problem(s) on your exam that you think were misgraded.  Regrade requests need to point out the aspect of the problem that was correct, but for which points were taken off.  We use a detailed rubric to grade exams, so simply requesting that an incorrect answer <i>"should be worth more points"</i> is not likely to result in additional points.  Also, we reserve the right to re-grade the whole exam to make sure there are no other grading issues present - this may result in a lower total score.

    </div>

    <p>
          One of the joys of programming is the ability to make something totally of your own creation. In CS106A this quarter we are hosting a Graphics Contest where you can program anything you like using the concepts and tools we learn in class. There will be four grand prizes which each are worth a 100% on the final exam. Serious entries and runners up will be awarded extra credit on assignments. See the <a href="{{pathToRoot}}handouts/11 - Graphics Contest.pdf">contest handout</a> for more details.   
    </p>

    <p>
         This contest is genuinely optional  (and in the genuine sense
of the word optional – not in some mischievous “this is extra credit but if you don’t do it, your grade will
suffer” sort of way). I will only apply bonuses
for the contest after I have calculated final grades for the class. Thus, if you don’t participate you are going
to get the exact same final grade in CS106A as you would have received had there been no contest.

            The exam will be administered digitally; if you do not have access to a laptop you feel comfortable using for the duration of the exam, please send Julia an email by <strong>Wednesday, May 2nd</strong>. Please bring a fully charged laptop to the exam. If you'd like extra assurance of access to an outlet, please feel free to bring an extension cord if you have one (we will have some, but extras are always helpful).
