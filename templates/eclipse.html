	  <p>In CS106A, we'll be using Stanford's customized version of
	  Eclipse to build our programs. Eclipse is an enormously popular
	  industrial-strength Java environment with many
	  features. Fortunately, Eclipse is also open source -- anyone is
	  free to change Eclipse to work the way they want. We have taken
	  advantage of that freedom to install special Stanford features
	  into Eclipse, tailoring it specifically for CS106A. This
	  document gives instructions on how to get started using Stanford
	  Eclipse. Please pay close attention to these instructions and do
	  not skip steps!</p>

		<!-- WINDOWS INSTALLATION -->
	  </p><h2 id="windows">Installing Eclipse in Windows</h2>
	  <p>Our version of Eclipse will run on Windows 7 (2009) or higher. In the very unlikely event you have an older version of Windows on your computer, you will need to either upgrade or do your class work in one of the public computer clusters. You can check your version of Windows using <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system"> these instructions</a>.</p>
	  <ol>
	    <li><strong>Uninstall previous versions of the
	    Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</strong>. Before installing a new version of the JRE, we
	    recommend that you remove any older copies that may be
	    installed on your system.
	      <p>
	      </p><ul>
		<li>
		  If you have Windows 7 or 8, do the following: Click
		  on <strong>Start</strong>, then click on <strong>Control
		   Panel</strong>, then select <strong>Programs and
		  Features</strong>.
		  <p>
		  If you have Windows 10, do the following: Click
		  on <strong>Start</strong> (the Windows icon in the lower
		  left-hand corner), then click
		  on <strong>Settings</strong> (the gear-shaped icon),
		  then select <strong>Apps &amp; Features</strong>.
		</p></li> 
		<p>
		</p><li>From the list of programs you see, uninstall
		any occurrences of Java/J2SE Runtime Environment, Java
		SDK, Java SE Development Kit or Java Update. Note that the
		exact program name may 
		be slightly different or include a version number, but you
		generally want to remove anything that includes the text:
		Java/J2SE Runtime Environment, Java SDK, Java SE
		Development Kit or Java Update. To remove a program, click
		on the program name to 
		highlight it and click the the <strong>Uninstall</strong>
		button.</li> 
		<p>
	      </p></ul>
	    </li>
	    <p>
	    </p><li><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/dept/cs_edu/eclipse/jdk_win64.exe">Download and install the JRE for Windows.</a>
		<br>After clicking this link a prompt
	    will appear to ask you whether you want to run or save the
	    file. Click <strong>Run</strong> to begin the download and
	    installation process. If you did not get a prompt to run the
	    file after the download completed, you should double-click the
	    file you downloaded to run it manually. If a subsequent
	    security warning dialog box appears, click <strong>Run</strong>
	    (or <strong>Yes</strong>) to continue with the
	    installation. The Java JRE installation program should
	    begin. Do a Typical installation (just use the default setting
	    in the installation process), and follow the rest of the
	    instructions given in order to complete your
	    installation.</li> 
	    <p>

	    </p><li><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/dept/cs_edu/eclipse/eclipse_win64.zip">Download Eclipse.</a>
<br>Save the downloaded file to somewhere on your hard drive.  This may
  take a little while as the file is rather large.
</li>
	    <p>
	    </p><li>Unzip/extract the contents of the file by right-clicking
	    on the folder you just downloaded, selecting
	    the <strong>Extract All...</strong> option and
	    typing <strong>C:\Program Files</strong> as the location to
	    extract the files to. 
	      Then continue following the steps in the extraction process. 
</li>
	    <p>
	    </p><li>Create a shortcut to Eclipse on your Desktop for easy
	    access â€” Open the <strong>C:\Program
	    Files\eclipse</strong> directory, and right-click and
	    drag the eclipse.exe file (the Eclipse application) to your
	    desktop and then select the option Create shortcut here.</li>
	    <p>
	    </p><li>Continue to the instructions below to <a href="#configure">configure Eclipse for CS106A</a>.</li>
	  </ol>

	    <p>
	    Note: If you installed the 64 bit versions of the software, and
	    find that you have issues running Eclipse, we recommend that
	    you uninstall the 64 bit versions of the both the JRE and
	    Eclipse and install the 32 bit versions of both: 
	    <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/dept/cs_edu/eclipse/jdk_win.exe">JRE 32 bit
	    version for Windows</a>, <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/dept/cs_edu/eclipse/eclipse_win.zip">Eclipse 32 bit version for Windows</a>.

	<!-- CONGIFURING STANFORD VERSION -->
	  </p><h2 id="configure">Configuring Eclipse for CS106A (both Mac and Windows)</h2>
	  <p>Once you have Eclipse installed on your computer, there are a few CS106A-specific changes you need to make so that you can access some special Stanford features, like submitting assignments. The following instructions apply to all operating systems, although the screenshots are from a Mac.</p>
	  <ol>
	  	<li><p></p>Open Eclipse if you haven't already. When you run Eclipse for the first time, you may get a screen that looks like this:<br>
	  		<img style="max-width:100%"src="{{pathToRoot}}img/eclipse/step0.png" alt="Eclipse Workspace Launcher dialog"><br>
	  		A workspace is just a directory that Eclipse will use to place new projects in. In 106A you won't have to make any new projects from scratch. We will always give you skeleton projects for your assignments, so you don't need to worry about where the workspace is. The suggested location is fine. Click the <strong>Use this as the default and do not ask again</strong> checkbox, and then click OK.
	    </li>
      <li><p></p>Once Eclipse has started, you can close the "Welcome" tab using the "X" in the top left.</li>
      <li><p></p>Click Help -&gt; Install New Software.</li>
      <li><p></p>In the "Work with" text box, type <strong>https://web.stanford.edu/dept/cs_edu/eclipse/plugin</strong> and press Enter.</li>
      <li><p></p>Click "Select All," then click Next.<br><img style = "max-width:100%" src="{{pathToRoot}}img/eclipse/step1.png" style="max-width:100%" alt="Eclipse Install Software dialog"></li>
      <li><p></p>Click Next again.<br><img src="{{pathToRoot}}img/eclipse/step2.png" style="max-width:100%" alt="Eclipse Install Details dialog"></li>
      <li><p></p>Click "I accept the terms of the license agreement," then click Finish.<br><img src="{{pathToRoot}}img/eclipse/step3.png" style="max-width:100%" alt="Eclipse License Agreement dialog"></li>
      <li><p></p>Click OK when you see the warning about installing unsigned content.<br><img src="{{pathToRoot}}img/eclipse/step4.png" style="max-width:100%" alt="Eclipse Security Warning dialog"></li>
      <li><p></p>Click Yes when asked to restart Eclipse.</li>
      <li><p></p>After restarting, you should see a "Stanford Menu" in the top bar, as well as several new icons in your top toolbar area.<br><img src="{{pathToRoot}}img/eclipse/step5.png" style="max-width:100%" alt="Eclipse with Stanford menu"></li>
      <li><p></p>Go to Eclipse -&gt; Preferences to open the Preferences window. In the dropdowns on the left, expand Run/Debug, and click Perspectives. Set "Open the associated perspective when an application suspends" to Never, as shown below, and click Apply and Close.<br><img src="{{pathToRoot}}img/eclipse/step6.png" style="max-width:100%" alt="Eclipse Debugger Preferences dialog"></li>
      <li><p></p>
      	Now that you have Eclipse loaded and configured, your next step is to add a project to your workspace by importing a skeletal framework that we provide with each assignment called a starter project. Using starter projects makes your life much easier by allowing you to ignore the many details involved in creating a project from scratch.  Every assignment will include a starter project for each problem, and your first task for each assignment will be to download the starter project from the class website and then import it into your workspace.  The details for doing so are described in the handout "Using Karel with Eclipse".<p></p> 
      </li>
    </ol>
