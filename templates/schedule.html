					Discussion Sections

				<p>
					In addition to lecture, you must sign up for a weekly 50-minute section. In order to take
CS 106B, you must sign up for a section between 5:00P.M., Thursday, January 7, and the
close of enrollments at 5:00P.M. on Sunday, January 10. Please use the signup form at
<a href="http://cs198.stanford.edu/section/">http://cs198.stanford.edu/section/</a>. Important note: Do not use Axess to sign
up for sections; section enrollments made through Axess are simply ignored.

impossible to assess in advance. The other components and the final grade are not
curved. If everyone does brilliantly in this class, everyone gets an A.

					Programming Assignments
				</h2>
				<p>
					CS 106B requires seven programming assignments, which are due on the dates given in
the syllabus. Except for Assignment #7 (which is due at the very end of the quarter),
your section leader will grade each of your assignments and then discuss how well you
have done (and how you can improve on future assignments) in an interactive,
one-on-one session. Assignments are graded separately for functionality and style.

				Late Policy

				<div class="subsection">
					
					<p>
						Each of the assignments is due at 5:00P.M. on the day specified in the syllabus.
Assignments are submitted electronically using the procedure described in the first
assignment. Important note: all assignments are due at 5:00P.M. sharp on the dates
indicated on the assignment handout. Assignments submitted after 5:00 will be
considered late.
					</p>
					<p>
						Because each of you will probably come upon some time during the quarter where so
much work piles up that you need a little extra time, every student begins the quarter with
three free “late days.” To avoid any ambiguity, a “day” is defined as a class day. Thus, if
your assignment was due on Friday but turned in the following Monday, that assignment
would be one day late. Note: You cannot use late days on Assignment #7, which is due at the end of the quarter. After your late days for the quarter are exhausted, programs are assessed a late
penalty of one category point per late day used (a ✓+ turns into a ✓, and so forth). Late
days are valuable, and it pays to keep some around for the harder assignments toward the
end of the quarter. In all cases, assignments must be turned in within a calendar week of
their published due date.
					</p>

					<p>
						In special circumstances (such as extended medical problems or other emergencies),
extensions may be granted beyond the late days. To request an extension, send e-mail to
the TA (Megan Faulk <mfaulk@stanford.edu>) no later than 24 hours before the
program is due. Only the TA is authorized to approve such extensions. In particular, do
not ask your section leader.
